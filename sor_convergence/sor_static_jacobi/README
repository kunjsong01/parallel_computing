This is the algorithm implementing Jacobi iteration to solve PDE. 
U(k+1) is independent of that of every other, i.e. it removes the dependency in the iteration space. 

The main idea used in parallel implementation for this program is pipeline.
The (i+1)-th thread won't start processing the assigned task (a row in this case) until the precedent thread, 
the i-th thread, finishes processing of the first element in its own assign task. 

Note that this idea requires the usage of the following scheduling method: 
    - schedule(static, 1) 

Chunk size being greater than one will not guaranteen the correct order of calculation in the iteration space.
